* **_Recent Items_: Fix "Authorization failed" error on checksum requests  ([#23607](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23607))**

  This issue causes a fatal error on some configurations (such as public-facing `webform`s that rely on checksums),
  even if the screen does not display "Recent Items".
