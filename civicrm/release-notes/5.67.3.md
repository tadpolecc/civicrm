## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_CiviMail_: Fix processing of inbound messages (bounces, unsubscribes, etc) ([dev/core#4775](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/4775), [dev/core#4816](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/4816): [#28355](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/28355))**

    For mailings sent with 5.67.0-5.67.2, inbound messages may be incorrectly ignored. After upgrading to 5.67.3+, you may reprocess messages: 

    * Login to your mail server.
    * Move recent messages from the "Ignored" folder to the regular "Inbox" folder.
    * Allow scheduled jobs to rerun.
